I use PSIAndroid for my server monitoring. When I see PSIAndroid's twitter, Erkan Valentin was recieved good idea. I sent mention that I want to multi-language support and translate system. (Like phpMyAdmin) After some minute, he sent message that it's good idea. I was downloaded 'string.xml' file and translate by Korean and sent to he. It is second participation to open-source software translation.

I could help by participating translate open-source softwere, so I feel good.
